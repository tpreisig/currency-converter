## Code Overview

- **State Management:** Uses `useState` for `amount`, `fromCurrency`, and `toCurrency`, and `result`.
- **API Fetching:** An async function `getExchangeRate` retrieves currency rates and updates `result`.
- **Effect Hook:** First fetch is triggered by `useEffect` on mount.
- **Event Handling:** Currency swap and form submission are handled with clean and reusable logic.
